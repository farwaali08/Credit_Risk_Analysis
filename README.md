# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## OVERVIEW

For this project, Python was used to create and assess several machine learning models in order to predict credit card risk.
We adopted the following procedure:

oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
Undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
We will evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
